# blm-image-classifier

This repository contains code for a self-trained convolutional neural network which can classify Black Lives Matter images as violent or non-violent from the platform Reddit.
You will need Python 3.x, a Tensorflow version of 2.6.0 or higher, and the libraries Newspaper3k, bing-image-downloader, Vader, and TextBlob.

This repository also contains additional code snippets for:

* testing the classifier with BLM images from Reddit
* downloading submissions from Reddit
* downloading images from news websites
* downloading images from search engine bing
* image augmentation
* sentiment analysis of Reddit submission titles
